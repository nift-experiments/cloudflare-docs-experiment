<div class="changelog-badges"><span>tunnel</span><span>cloudflare-tunnel-sase</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p>Your real-time applications running over <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/">Cloudflare Tunnel</a> are now faster and more reliable. We've completely re-architected the way <code>cloudflared</code> proxies UDP traffic in order to isolate it from other traffic, ensuring latency-sensitive applications like private DNS are no longer slowed down by heavy TCP traffic (like file transfers) on the same Tunnel.</p>
<p>This is a foundational improvement to Cloudflare Tunnel, delivered automatically to all customers. There are no settings to configure — your UDP traffic is already flowing faster and more reliably.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster UDP performance</strong>: We've significantly reduced the latency for establishing new UDP sessions, making applications like private DNS much more responsive.</li>
<li><strong>Greater reliability for mixed traffic</strong>: UDP packets are no longer affected by heavy TCP traffic, preventing timeouts and connection drops for your real-time services.</li>
</ul>
