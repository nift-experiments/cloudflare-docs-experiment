<time>January 14, 2026</time><h2 id="post-title">WARP client for macOS (version 2025.10.186.0)</h2>
<div class="changelog-badges"><span>cloudflare-one-client</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p>A new GA release for the macOS WARP client is now available on the <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/">stable releases downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>This release contains minor fixes, improvements, and new features, including the ability to manage WARP client connectivity for all devices in your fleet using an <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/emergency-disconnect/#set-up-external-emergency-disconnect">external signal</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/local-domains/">Local Domain Fallback</a> feature has been fixed for devices running WARP client version 2025.4.929.0 and newer. Previously, these devices could experience failures with Local Domain Fallback unless a fallback server was explicitly configured. This configuration is no longer a requirement for the feature to function correctly.</li>
<li><a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/modes/#local-proxy-mode">Proxy mode</a> now supports transparent HTTP proxying in addition to CONNECT-based proxying.</li>
<li>Added a new feature to manage WARP client connectivity for all devices using an <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/emergency-disconnect/#set-up-external-emergency-disconnect">external signal</a>. This feature allows administrators to send a global signal from an on-premises HTTPS endpoint that force disconnects or reconnects all WARP clients in an account based on configuration set on the endpoint.</li>
</ul>
