<time>March 11, 2026</time><h2 id="post-title">WARP client for macOS (version 2026.3.566.1)</h2>
<div class="changelog-badges"><span>cloudflare-one-client</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p>A new Beta release for the macOS WARP client is now available on the <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/beta-releases/">beta releases downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>This release contains minor fixes and introduces a brand new visual style for the client interface. The new Cloudflare One Client interface changes connectivity management from a toggle to a button and brings useful connectivity settings to the home screen. The redesign also introduces a collapsible navigation bar. When expanded, more client information can be accessed including connectivity, settings, and device profile information. If you have any feedback or questions, visit the <a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/introducing-the-new-cloudflare-one-client-interface/901362">Cloudflare Community forum</a> and let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Empty MDM files are now rejected instead of being incorrectly accepted as a single MDM config.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in proxy mode where the client could become unresponsive due to upstream connection timeouts.</li>
<li>Fixed emergency disconnect state from a previous organization incorrectly persisting after switching organizations.</li>
<li>Consumer-only CLI commands are now clearly distinguished from Zero Trust commands.</li>
<li>Added detailed QUIC connection metrics to diagnostic logs for better troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Added monitoring for tunnel statistics collection timeouts.</li>
<li>Switched tunnel congestion control algorithm to Cubic for improved reliability across platforms.</li>
<li>Fixed initiating managed network detection checks when no network is available, which caused device profile flapping.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The client may become stuck in a <code>Connecting</code> state. To resolve this issue, reconnect the client by selecting <strong>Disconnect</strong> and then <strong>Connect</strong> in the client user interface. Alternatively, change the client's operation mode.</li>
<li>The client may display an empty white screen upon the device waking from sleep. To resolve this issue, exit and then open the client to re-launch it.</li>
<li>Canceling login during a single MDM configuration setup results in an empty page with no way to resume authentication. To work around this issue, exit and relaunch the client.</li>
</ul>
