<time>April 8, 2026</time><h2 id="post-title">Cloudflare One Client for Windows (version 2026.3.851.0)</h2>
<div class="changelog-badges"><span>cloudflare-one-client</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p>A new GA release for the Windows Cloudflare One Client is now available on the <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/">stable releases downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>This release contains minor fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>The next stable release for Windows will introduce the new Cloudflare One Client UI, providing a cleaner and more intuitive design as well as easier access to common actions and information.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing Windows client tunnel interface initialization failure which prevented clients from establishing a tunnel for connection.</li>
<li>Consumer-only CLI commands are now clearly distinguished from Zero Trust commands.</li>
<li>Added detailed QUIC connection metrics to diagnostic logs for better troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Added monitoring for tunnel statistics collection timeouts.</li>
<li>Switched tunnel congestion control algorithm for local proxy mode to Cubic for improved reliability across platforms.</li>
<li>Fixed packet capture failing on tunnel interface when the tunnel interface is renamed by SCCM VPN boundary support.</li>
<li>Fixed unnecessary registration deletion caused by RDP connections in multi-user mode.</li>
<li>Fixed increased tunnel interface start-up time due to a race between duplicate address detection (DAD) and disabling NetBT.</li>
<li>Fixed tunnel failing to connect when the system DNS search list contains unexpected characters.</li>
<li>Empty MDM files are now rejected instead of being incorrectly accepted as a single MDM config.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in local proxy mode where the client could become unresponsive due to upstream connection timeouts.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the emergency disconnect status of a prior organization persisted after a switch to a different organization.</li>
<li>Fixed initiating managed network detections checks when no network is available, which caused device profile flapping.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where degraded Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) state could put the client in a failed connection state loop during initialization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For Windows 11 24H2 users, Microsoft has confirmed a regression that may lead to performance issues like mouse lag, audio cracking, or other slowdowns. Cloudflare recommends users experiencing these issues upgrade to a minimum <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-8-2025-kb5062553-os-build-26100-4652-523e69cb-051b-43c6-8376-6a76d6caeefd">Windows 11 24H2 version KB5062553</a> or higher for resolution. This warning will be omitted from future release notes. This Windows update was released in July 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devices with KB5055523 installed may receive a warning about <code>Win32/ClickFix.ABA</code> being present in the installer. To resolve this false positive, update Microsoft Security Intelligence to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions/antimalware-definition-release-notes?requestVersion=1.429.19.0">version 1.429.19.0</a> or later. This warning will be omitted from future release notes. This Microsoft Security Intelligence update was released in May 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.</li>
<li>A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.</li>
<li>The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while the client is connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>To work around this issue, reconnect the client by selecting <strong>Disconnect</strong> and then <strong>Connect</strong> in the client user interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
