<div class="changelog-badges"><span>mesh</span><span>tunnel</span><span>cloudflare-wan</span><span>cloudflare-one</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p>The <strong>Routes</strong> page in the Cloudflare dashboard now shows the routes across all of your connectors — <a href="/mesh/">Cloudflare Mesh</a> and <a href="/tunnel/">Cloudflare Tunnel</a> routes alongside <a href="/cloudflare-wan/">Cloudflare WAN</a> and <a href="/magic-transit/">Magic Transit</a> static routes — in a single table, instead of a separate routes view per product.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/upstream/images/changelog/cloudflare-one/2026-06-19-unified-routes.gif" alt="The unified Routes page in the Cloudflare dashboard, showing routes across connectors in a single table" /></p>
<p>From the unified Routes page you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visualize your network with an interactive map</strong> that shows how your destinations flow through to your connectors — including equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routes where the same prefix is served by several connectors. Select a node to filter the table down to the routes behind it.</li>
<li><strong>See every route in one table</strong>, with its destination, type, connector, priority, and source, and filter or sort to find what you need.</li>
<li><strong>Create, edit, and delete routes</strong> of any supported type without leaving the page. When adding a Cloudflare WAN or Magic Transit static route, you now pick the next hop by <strong>connector name</strong> instead of typing its IP.</li>
<li><strong>Manage <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/virtual-networks/">virtual networks</a></strong> from a dedicated tab.</li>
<li><strong>Test a route</strong> to see which connector and next hop a destination resolves to before you commit a change.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find it, go to <strong>Networking</strong> &gt; <strong>Routes</strong> in the dashboard sidebar.</p>
