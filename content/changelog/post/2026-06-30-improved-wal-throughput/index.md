<time>July 1, 2026</time><h2 id="post-title">Reduced end-to-end latency for vector changes</h2>
<div class="changelog-badges"><span>vectorize</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p>We have greatly improved the throughput of the Vectorize <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-vectorize-a-distributed-vector-database-on-cloudflare-developer-platform/#the-wal">write-ahead log (WAL)</a>. As a result, we have significantly reduced the end-to-end latency for a vector change to become queryable: median latency has dropped from 2 minutes to under 30 seconds, and p99 latency from 5 minutes to under 2 minutes.</p>

<p>This means inserts, upserts, and deletes are reflected in query results faster, improving the freshness of semantic search, recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workloads. You do not need to change your code or configuration to benefit from this improvement.</p>
