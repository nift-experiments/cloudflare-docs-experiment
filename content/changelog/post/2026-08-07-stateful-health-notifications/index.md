<div class="changelog-badges"><span>load-balancing</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p><a href="/load-balancing/">Load Balancing</a> health notifications are now stateful. When a pool or endpoint becomes unhealthy, the notification opens an incident in your alerting tool as before. When that same pool or endpoint recovers, the follow-up notification is matched to the original alert and resolves that incident automatically, so you no longer have to close it by hand.</p>
<p>As part of this change, Load Balancing also sends a notification when a pool or endpoint returns to a healthy state, not only when it becomes unhealthy. Expect to see recovery notifications alongside the failure notifications you already receive.</p>
<p>This applies to your existing Load Balancing health alerts with no configuration change, and it matches the behavior already used by <a href="/health-checks/">Health Checks</a> notifications.</p>
<p>Two things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A recovery notification is matched to the earlier unhealthy notification for the <strong>same pool or endpoint</strong>. Renaming an endpoint while an incident is open prevents the match, so that incident stays open until you close it.</li>
<li>If a health change cannot be classified as either healthy or unhealthy, the notification is still delivered, but without the state needed to open or resolve an incident.</li>
</ul>
