<div class="changelog-badges"><span>cloudflare-one-client</span></div><div class="changelog-body"><p>A new Beta release for the Windows Cloudflare One Client is now available on the <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/beta-releases/">beta releases downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>This beta release includes the following changes and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for routing non-RFC 1918 local IPv4 networks through the WARP tunnel when unrestricted LAN inclusion is enabled by policy or MDM.</li>
<li>Improved DNS reliability on networks with lower MTUs by clamping the TCP maximum segment size (MSS) for DNS-over-HTTPS connections sent through the tunnel.</li>
<li>Improved API reliability by retrying requests dropped when reusing pooled connections.</li>
<li>The client no longer requires the Windows WLAN AutoConfig service to be running.</li>
<li>Implemented a service recovery mechanism backed by Windows scheduler task to start WARP service on system unlock if not already started.</li>
<li>Fixed slow captive portal checks causing the client service to become unresponsive or restart while connecting.</li>
<li>Fixed a race when switching tunnel protocols during key rotation that could prevent WireGuard from connecting.</li>
<li>Fixed the client continuing to report 'No network' after a successful manual disconnect.</li>
<li>Fixed Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX) HTTP tests failing TLS validation on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed the client UI crashing at startup when it could not write to the Windows registry.</li>
<li>Fixed latency spikes and traffic interruptions during TPM-backed API authentication when hardware-backed registration is enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed trailing whitespace in BIOS serial numbers causing serial-number and client-certificate device posture checks to fail.</li>
<li>Fixed a client UI crash that could occur when the daemon connection was reset during an IPC request.</li>
<li>Fixed a startup crash when date formatting data for the system locale had not yet loaded.</li>
