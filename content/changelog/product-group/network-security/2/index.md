<h2 id="source-based-breakout-and-prioritization-on-cloudflare-one-appliance"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-05-07-appliance-source-based-breakout/">Source-based breakout and prioritization on Cloudflare One Appliance</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-05-07</em></p>
<p>Breakout and traffic prioritization rules on the Cloudflare One Appliance can now match by <strong>source</strong> in addition to destination application. You can pin breakout or priority behavior to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A source LAN interface — VLANs attached to that LAN are included automatically.</li>
<li>A source IP address, range, or CIDR block.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the natural way to break out a guest VLAN to the local Internet, or to prioritize traffic from a specific subnet, without enumerating destination applications.</p>
<p>For details, refer to <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/network-options/application-based-policies/breakout-traffic/#breakout-by-source">Breakout traffic</a>.</p>


<h2 id="self-serve-provisioning-of-cloudflare-one-virtual-appliance-via-api"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-05-07-virtual-appliance-self-serve-api/">Self-serve provisioning of Cloudflare One Virtual Appliance via API</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-05-07</em></p>
<p>You can now create, rotate, and delete Cloudflare One Virtual Appliance instances and their license keys directly via the API and Terraform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a virtual appliance and receive a license key: <code>POST /accounts/{account_id}/magic/connectors</code> with <code>device.provision_license: true</code>.</li>
<li>Rotate the license key for an existing virtual appliance: <code>PATCH /accounts/{account_id}/magic/connectors/{connector_id}</code> with <code>provision_license: true</code>. The previous key is immediately and irrevocably revoked.</li>
<li>Delete a virtual appliance to release the associated licensed device.</li>
</ul>
<p>The license key is returned in the response only once, at create or rotate time. Copy and store it securely.</p>

<h2 id="post-quantum-ipsec-interoperability-with-third-party-devices"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-04-30-ipsec-post-quantum-third-party/">Post-quantum IPsec interoperability with third-party devices</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-04-30</em></p>
<p>Cloudflare IPsec now supports post-quantum key agreement with compatible third-party devices. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a> and <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/">Fortinet</a> are the first third-party vendors validated to interoperate with Cloudflare IPsec using ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism).</p>
<p>Post-quantum IPsec uses <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9370/">RFC 9370</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem/">draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem</a> to negotiate hybrid key agreement during the IKEv2 <code>IKE_INTERMEDIATE</code> phase. This combines classical Diffie-Hellman (Group 20) with ML-KEM-768 or ML-KEM-1024 to protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later">harvest-now, decrypt-later</a> attacks.</p>
<p>Key details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatible with Cisco 8000 Series Secure Routers with IOS XR Release 26.1.1 and Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.6 and later.</li>
<li>Uses ML-KEM-768 or ML-KEM-1024 as an additional Key Exchange to DH Group 20.</li>
<li>Follows RFC 9370 and draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem standards.</li>
<li>No additional licensing required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-quantum IPsec with third-party devices is now generally available with confirmed interoperability for the platforms listed above. Cloudflare intends to support interoperability with more vendors as they build out support for draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem. Contact your account team to discuss support for additional vendors.</p>

<h2 id="country-rules-supported-in-unified-routing"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-04-21-unified-routing-geoip-country-rules/">Country rules supported in Unified Routing</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-04-21T12:00:00</em></p>
<p><a href="/cloudflare-network-firewall/">Cloudflare Advanced Network Firewall</a> Country rules are now supported for accounts using <a href="/cloudflare-wan/reference/traffic-steering/#unified-routing-mode-beta">Unified Routing</a> mode. This feature requires a Cloudflare Advanced Network Firewall subscription.</p>
<p>You can create firewall rules that match traffic based on source or destination country to enforce geographic access policies across your network.</p>
<p>This is the first of the Cloudflare Advanced Network Firewall features to become available in Unified Routing. Support for additional features - IP Lists, ASN Lists, Threat Intel Lists, IDS, Rate Limiting, SIP, and Managed Rulesets - is planned.</p>

<h2 id="link-aggregation-lacp-support-for-cloudflare-one-appliance"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-04-07-link-aggregation-lacp-appliance/">Link aggregation (LACP) support for Cloudflare One Appliance</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-04-07</em></p>
<p>Cloudflare One Appliance now supports Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), allowing you to bundle up to six physical LAN ports into a single logical interface. Link aggregation increases available bandwidth and eliminates single points of failure on the LAN side of the appliance.</p>
<p>This feature is available in beta on physical appliance hardware with the latest OS. No entitlement is required.</p>

<h2 id="new-quic-rtt-and-delivery-rate-fields"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-04-01-quic-rtt-delivery-rate-fields/">New QUIC RTT and delivery rate fields</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-04-01</em></p>
<p>Two new fields are now available in rule expressions that surface Layer 4 transport telemetry from the client connection. Together with the existing <a href="/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/"><code>cf.timings.client_tcp_rtt_msec</code></a> field, these fields give you a complete picture of connection quality for both TCP and QUIC traffic — enabling transport-aware rules without requiring any client-side changes.</p>
<p>Previously, QUIC RTT and delivery rate data was only available via the <code>Server-Timing: cfL4</code> response header. These new fields make the same data available directly in rule expressions, so you can use them in Transform Rules, WAF Custom Rules, and other phases that support dynamic fields.</p>

<h2 id="new-mtls-certificate-fields-for-transform-rules"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-03-25-rfc9440-mtls-fields/">New mTLS certificate fields for Transform Rules</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-03-25</em></p>
<p>Cloudflare now exposes four new fields in the Transform Rules phase that encode client certificate data in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9440">RFC 9440</a> format. Previously, forwarding client certificate information to your origin required custom parsing of PEM-encoded fields or non-standard HTTP header formats. These new fields produce output in the standardized <code>Client-Cert</code> and <code>Client-Cert-Chain</code> header format defined by RFC 9440, so your origin can consume them directly without any additional decoding logic.</p>
<p>Each certificate is DER-encoded, Base64-encoded, and wrapped in colons. For example, <code>:MIIDsT...Vw==:</code>. A chain of intermediates is expressed as a comma-separated list of such values.</p>
<h4 id="2026-03-25-rfc9440-mtls-fields-new-fields">New fields</h4>

<p>The chain encoding follows the same ordering as the TLS handshake: the certificate closest to the leaf appears first, working up toward the trust anchor. The root certificate is not included.</p>
<h4 id="2026-03-25-rfc9440-mtls-fields-example-forwarding-client-certificate-headers-to-your-origin-server">Example: Forwarding client certificate headers to your origin server</h4>
<p>Add a request header transform rule to set the <code>Client-Cert</code> and <code>Client-Cert-Chain</code> headers on requests forwarded to your origin server. For example, to forward headers for verified, non-revoked certificates:</p>
<p><strong>Rule expression:</strong></p>

<p><em>2026-02-11</em></p>
<p>Cloudflare One Appliance version 2026.2.0 adds <a href="/ssl/post-quantum-cryptography/">post-quantum encryption</a> support using hybrid ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism).</p>
<p>The appliance now uses TLS 1.3 with hybrid ML-KEM for its connection to the Cloudflare edge. During the TLS handshake, the appliance and the edge share a symmetric secret over the TLS connection and inject it into the ESP layer of IPsec. This protects IPsec data plane traffic against harvest-now, decrypt-later attacks.</p>
<p>This upgrade deploys automatically to all appliances during their configured interrupt windows with no manual action required.</p>

<p>Magic WAN and Magic Transit customers can use the Cloudflare dashboard to configure and manage BGP peering between their networks and their Magic routing table when using IPsec and GRE tunnel on-ramps (beta).</p>
<p>Using BGP peering allows customers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate the process of adding or removing networks and subnets.</li>
<li>Take advantage of failure detection and session recovery features.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this functionality, customers can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish an eBGP session between their devices and the Magic WAN / Magic Transit service when connected via IPsec and GRE tunnel on-ramps.</li>
<li>Secure the session by MD5 authentication to prevent misconfigurations.</li>
<li>Exchange routes dynamically between their devices and their Magic routing table.</li>

<p><em>2026-01-27</em></p>
<p>Cloudflare source IPs are the IP addresses used by Cloudflare services (such as Load Balancing, Gateway, and Browser Isolation) when sending traffic to your private networks.</p>
<p>For customers using legacy mode routing, traffic to private networks is sourced from public Cloudflare IPs, which may cause IP conflicts. For customers using Unified Routing mode (beta), traffic to private networks is sourced from dedicated, non-Internet-routable private IPv4 range to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetric routing over private network connections</li>
<li>Proper firewall state preservation</li>
<li>Private traffic stays on secure paths</li>
</ul>
<p>Key details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPv4</strong>: Sourced from <code>100.64.0.0/12</code> by default, configurable to any <code>/12</code> CIDR</li>
<li><strong>IPv6</strong>: Sourced from <code>2606:4700:cf1:5000::/64</code> (not configurable)</li>
<li><strong>Affected connectors</strong>: GRE, IPsec, CNI, WARP Connector, and WARP Client (Cloudflare Tunnel is not affected)</li>

<h2 id="verify-warp-connector-connectivity-with-a-simple-ping"><a href="/changelog/post/2026-01-15-warp-connector-ping-support/">Verify WARP Connector connectivity with a simple ping</a></h2>
<p><em>2026-01-15</em></p>
<p>We have made it easier to validate connectivity when deploying <a href="/mesh/">WARP Connector</a> as part of your <a href="/reference-architecture/architectures/sase/#connecting-networks">software-defined private network</a>.</p>
<p>You can now <code>ping</code> the WARP Connector host directly on its LAN IP address immediately after installation. This provides a fast, familiar way to confirm that the Connector is online and reachable within your network before testing access to downstream services.</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="/changelog/2026-01-13-warp-linux-ga/">version 2025.10.186.0</a>, WARP Connector responds to traffic addressed to its own LAN IP, giving you immediate visibility into Connector reachability.</p>

<h2 id="breakout-traffic-visibility-via-netflow"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-12-31-connector-breakout-traffic-netflow/">Breakout traffic visibility via NetFlow</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-12-31</em></p>
<p>Magic WAN Connector now exports NetFlow data for breakout traffic to Magic Network Monitoring (MNM), providing visibility into traffic that bypasses Cloudflare's security filtering.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor breakout traffic statistics in the Cloudflare dashboard.</li>
<li>View traffic patterns for applications configured to bypass Cloudflare.</li>
<li>Maintain visibility across all traffic passing through your Magic WAN Connector.</li>

<h2 id="cloudflared-proxy-dns-command-will-be-removed-starting-february-2-2026"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-11-11-cloudflared-proxy-dns/">cloudflared proxy-dns command will be removed starting February 2, 2026</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-11-11</em></p>
<p>Starting February 2, 2026, the <code>cloudflared proxy-dns</code> command will be removed from all new <code>cloudflared</code> <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/">releases</a>.</p>
<p>This change is being made to enhance security and address a potential vulnerability in an underlying DNS library. This vulnerability is specific to the <code>proxy-dns</code> command and does not affect any other <code>cloudflared</code> features, such as the core <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/">Cloudflare Tunnel</a> service.</p>
<p>The <code>proxy-dns</code> command, which runs a client-side <a href="/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> proxy, has been an officially undocumented feature for several years. This functionality is fully and securely supported by our actively developed products.</p>
<p>Versions of <code>cloudflared</code> released before this date will not be affected and will continue to operate. However, note that our <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#deprecated-releases">official support policy</a> for any <code>cloudflared</code> release is one year from its release date.</p>
<h4 id="2025-11-11-cloudflared-proxy-dns-migration-paths">Migration paths</h4>
<p>We strongly advise users of this undocumented feature to migrate to one of the following officially supported solutions before February 2, 2026, to continue benefiting from secure <a href="/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/">DNS-over-HTTPS</a>.</p>
<h4 id="2025-11-11-cloudflared-proxy-dns-end-user-devices">End-user devices</h4>
<p>The preferred method for enabling DNS-over-HTTPS on user devices is the <a href="/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/">Cloudflare WARP client</a>. The WARP client automatically secures and proxies all DNS traffic from your device, integrating it with your organization's <a href="/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/">Zero Trust policies</a> and <a href="/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/">posture checks</a>.</p>
<h4 id="2025-11-11-cloudflared-proxy-dns-servers-routers-and-iot-devices">Servers, routers, and IoT devices</h4>
<p>For scenarios where installing a client on every device is not possible (such as servers, routers, or IoT devices), we recommend using the <a href="/mesh/">WARP Connector</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of running <code>cloudflared proxy-dns</code> on a machine, you can install the WARP Connector on a single Linux host within your private network. This connector will act as a gateway, securely routing all DNS and network traffic from your <a href="/mesh/features/routes/">entire subnet</a> to Cloudflare for <a href="/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/">filtering and logging</a>.</p>
