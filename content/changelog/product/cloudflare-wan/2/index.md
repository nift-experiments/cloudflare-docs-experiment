<h2 id="breakout-traffic-visibility-via-netflow"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-12-31-connector-breakout-traffic-netflow/">Breakout traffic visibility via NetFlow</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-12-31</em></p>
<p>Magic WAN Connector now exports NetFlow data for breakout traffic to Magic Network Monitoring (MNM), providing visibility into traffic that bypasses Cloudflare's security filtering.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor breakout traffic statistics in the Cloudflare dashboard.</li>
<li>View traffic patterns for applications configured to bypass Cloudflare.</li>
<li>Maintain visibility across all traffic passing through your Magic WAN Connector.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, refer to <a href="/cloudflare-wan/analytics/netflow-analytics/">NetFlow statistics</a>.</p>


<h2 id="automatic-return-routing-beta"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-11-06-automatic-return-routing-beta/">Automatic Return Routing (Beta)</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-11-06</em></p>
<p>Magic WAN now supports Automatic Return Routing (ARR), allowing customers to configure Magic on-ramps (IPsec/GRE/CNI) to learn the return path for traffic flows without requiring static routes.</p>
<p>Key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Route-less mode</strong>: Static or dynamic routes are optional when using ARR.</li>
<li><strong>Overlapping IP space support</strong>: Traffic originating from customer sites can use overlapping private IP ranges.</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric routing</strong>: Return traffic is guaranteed to use the same connection as the original on-ramp.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is currently in beta and requires the new Unified Routing mode (beta).</p>
<p>For configuration details, refer to <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-automatic-return-routing-beta">Configure Automatic Return Routing</a>.</p>


<h2 id="designate-wan-link-for-breakout-traffic"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-11-06-connector-designate-wan-link-breakout/">Designate WAN link for breakout traffic</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-11-06</em></p>
<p>Magic WAN Connector now allows you to designate a specific WAN port for breakout traffic, giving you deterministic control over the egress path for latency-sensitive applications.</p>
<p>With this feature, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pin breakout traffic for specific applications to a preferred WAN port.</li>
<li>Ensure critical traffic (such as Zoom or Teams) always uses your fastest or most reliable connection.</li>
<li>Benefit from automatic failover to standard WAN port priority if the preferred port goes down.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is useful for organizations with multiple ISP uplinks who need predictable egress behavior for performance-sensitive traffic.</p>
<p>For configuration details, refer to <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/network-options/application-based-policies/breakout-traffic/#designate-wan-ports-for-breakout-apps">Designate WAN ports for breakout apps</a>.</p>


<h2 id="dns-filtering-for-private-network-onramps"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-09-11-dns-filtering-for-private-network-onramps/">DNS filtering for private network onramps</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-09-11</em></p>
<p><a href="/cloudflare-wan/zero-trust/cloudflare-gateway/#dns-filtering">Magic WAN</a> and <a href="/mesh/features/routes/#dns-filtering">WARP Connector</a> users can now securely route their DNS traffic to the Gateway resolver without exposing traffic to the public Internet.</p>
<p>Routing DNS traffic to the Gateway resolver allows DNS resolution and filtering for traffic coming from private networks while preserving source internal IP visibility. This ensures Magic WAN users have full integration with our Cloudflare One features, including <a href="/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/#internal-dns">Internal DNS</a> and <a href="/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/egress-policies/#selector-prerequisites">hostname-based policies</a>.</p>
<p>To configure DNS filtering, change your Magic WAN or WARP Connector DNS settings to use Cloudflare's shared resolver IPs, <code>172.64.36.1</code> and <code>172.64.36.2</code>. Once you configure DNS resolution and filtering, you can use <em>Source Internal IP</em> as a traffic selector in your <a href="/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/">resolver policies</a> for routing private DNS traffic to your <a href="/dns/internal-dns/">Internal DNS</a>.</p>


<h2 id="custom-ike-id-for-ipsec-tunnels"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-09-08-custom-ike-id-ipsec-tunnels/">Custom IKE ID for IPsec Tunnels</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-09-08</em></p>
<p>Now, Magic WAN customers can configure a custom IKE ID for their IPsec tunnels. Customers that are using Magic WAN and a VeloCloud SD-WAN device together can utilize this new feature to create a high availability configuration.</p>
<p>This feature is available via API only. Customers can read the Magic WAN documentation to learn more about the <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/common-settings/custom-ike-id-ipsec/">Custom IKE ID feature and the API call to configure it</a>.</p>


<h2 id="bidirectional-tunnel-health-checks-are-compatible-with-all-magic-on-ramps"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-09-05-bidirectional-health-check-any-on-ramp/">Bidirectional tunnel health checks are compatible with all Magic on-ramps</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-09-05</em></p>
<p>All bidirectional tunnel health check return packets are accepted by any Magic on-ramp.</p>
<p>Previously, when a Magic tunnel had a bidirectional health check configured, the bidirectional health check would pass when the return packets came back to Cloudflare over the same tunnel that was traversed by the forward packets.</p>
<p>There are SD-WAN devices, like VeloCloud, that do not offer controls to steer traffic over one tunnel versus another in a high availability tunnel configuration.</p>
<p>Now, when a Magic tunnel has a bidirectional health check configured, the bidirectional health check will pass when the return packet traverses over any tunnel in a high availability configuration.</p>


<h2 id="terraform-v5-support-for-tunnels-and-routes"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-07-31-terraform-v5-tunnels-routes/">Terraform V5 support for tunnels and routes</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-07-31</em></p>
<p>The Cloudflare Terraform provider resources for Cloudflare WAN tunnels and routes now support Terraform provider version 5. Customers using infrastructure-as-code workflows can manage their tunnel and route configuration with the latest provider version.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs">Cloudflare Terraform provider documentation</a>.</p>


<h2 id="magic-transit-and-magic-wan-health-check-data-is-fully-compatible-with-the-cmb-eu-setting"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-07-30-mt-mwan-health-check-cmb-eu/">Magic Transit and Magic WAN health check data is fully compatible with the CMB EU setting.</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-07-30</em></p>
<p>Today, we are excited to announce that all Magic Transit and Magic WAN customers with CMB EU (<a href="/data-localization/metadata-boundary/">Customer Metadata Boundary - Europe</a>) enabled in their account will be able to access GRE, IPsec, and CNI health check and traffic volume data in the Cloudflare dashboard and via API.</p>
<p>This ensures that all Magic Transit and Magic WAN customers with CMB EU enabled will be able to access all Magic Transit and Magic WAN features.</p>
<p>Specifically, these two GraphQL endpoints are now compatible with CMB EU:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>magicTransitTunnelHealthChecksAdaptiveGroups</code></li>
<li><code>magicTransitTunnelTrafficAdaptiveGroups</code></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="virtual-cloudflare-one-appliance-with-kvm-support-open-beta"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-07-21-virtual-appliance-kvm-proxmox/">Virtual Cloudflare One Appliance with KVM support (open beta)</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-07-21</em></p>
<p>The KVM-based virtual Cloudflare One Appliance is now in open beta with official support for Proxmox VE.</p>
<p>Customers can deploy the virtual appliance on KVM hypervisors to connect branch or data center networks to Cloudflare WAN without dedicated hardware.</p>

<h2 id="cloudflare-one-appliance-supports-multiple-dns-server-ips"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-04-30-appliance-multiple-dns-servers/">Cloudflare One Appliance supports multiple DNS server IPs</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-04-30</em></p>
<p>Cloudflare One Appliance DHCP server settings now support specifying multiple DNS server IP addresses in the DHCP pool.</p>
<p>Previously, customers could only configure a single DNS server per DHCP pool. With this update, you can specify multiple DNS servers to provide redundancy for clients at branch locations.</p>
<p>For configuration details, refer to <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/network-options/dhcp/dhcp-server/">DHCP server</a>.</p>


<h2 id="configure-your-magic-wan-connector-to-connect-via-static-ip-assignment"><a href="/changelog/post/2025-02-14-local-console-access/">Configure your Magic WAN Connector to connect via static IP assignment</a></h2>
<p><em>2025-02-14</em></p>
<p>You can now locally configure your <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/">Magic WAN Connector</a> to work in a static IP configuration.</p>
<p>This local method does not require having access to a DHCP Internet connection. However, it does require being comfortable with using tools to access the serial port on Magic WAN Connector as well as using a serial terminal client to access the Connector's environment.</p>
<p>For more details, refer to <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/configure-hardware-appliance/#bootstrap-via-serial-console">WAN with a static IP address</a>.</p>


<h2 id="establish-bgp-peering-over-direct-cni-circuits"><a href="/changelog/post/2024-12-17-bgp-support-cni/">Establish BGP peering over Direct CNI circuits</a></h2>
<p><em>2024-12-17</em></p>
<p>Magic WAN and Magic Transit customers can use the Cloudflare dashboard to configure and manage BGP peering between their networks and their Magic routing table when using a Direct CNI on-ramp.</p>
<p>Using BGP peering allows customers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate the process of adding or removing networks and subnets.</li>
<li>Take advantage of failure detection and session recovery features.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this functionality, customers can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish an eBGP session between their devices and the Magic WAN / Magic Transit service when connected via CNI.</li>
<li>Secure the session by MD5 authentication to prevent misconfigurations.</li>
<li>Exchange routes dynamically between their devices and their Magic routing table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-bgp-routes">Magic WAN BGP peering</a> or <a href="/magic-transit/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-bgp-routes">Magic Transit BGP peering</a> to learn more about this feature and how to set it up.</p>
