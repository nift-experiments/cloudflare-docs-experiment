<p><em>2026-06-23</em></p>
<p>Regional Services now supports <strong>Regionalized IP Bindings</strong>, letting you regionalize traffic at the IP layer for prefixes you bring to Cloudflare through <a href="/byoip/">Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)</a>.</p>
<p>Where <a href="/data-localization/regional-services/regional-hostnames/">Regional Hostnames</a> regionalize traffic by hostname, Regionalized IP Bindings let you bind a CIDR from one of your prefixes to a region — ideal for address-map deployments and any service you address by IP rather than hostname. Cloudflare then terminates TLS and processes traffic to those addresses only within the data centers in that region.</p>
<p>Regionalized IP Bindings requires the Regional Services and Regional Services for BYOIP entitlements. Contact your account team to enable them.</p>
<p>To get started, refer to <a href="/data-localization/regional-services/ip-bindings/">Regionalized IP Bindings</a>.</p>
